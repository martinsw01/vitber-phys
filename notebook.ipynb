    "In this text we will look, numerically, at the stability of a ship. For a ship to be able to sail across the ocean, it needs to have a certain amount of stability. This stability prevents it from capsizing from the forces that are bound to be affecting the ship on its tour. We will look at how different initial conditions, as well as other factors, such as waves, affects the stability of a ship."

This simplification does not affect the final result considerably, as it is safe to assume that the forces are close to constant throughout the ship, and our interest is in whether the ship will capsize."
